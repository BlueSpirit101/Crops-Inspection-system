# Crops-Inspection-system
This project is about the inspection of health or diseases on our local cash crops.
As this is the initial stage of the project, i will add few crops available or grown in our hilly areas with few descriptions as well as the procedure for disease detection, its preventive and controlling measures along with recomenations. 
One can type symptoms observed in their crops, and can have a best match pictures made available in this project and disease detection on accordance.
since our project is in its primitive stage, no sensors or actuactors or real time monitoring system is applied. Thus, only the time line of the user/farmer input will be in record for the history record of the user/farmer for better observation, study and acknowledge the way to cultivate their desired crops.
Besides necessary suppliments, fertilizers or pesticides, no soil quality or it's PH value will be in focus in this project..
Hope to begin with good flow... heheeheee...
